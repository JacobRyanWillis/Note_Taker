# Note_Taker_Application

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to get more familiar with using express to communicate with a server then deploying our applications to Heroku. I learned effective use of GET, DELETE, and POST methods. I learned how to structure my code better using routes and Router methods. Express was challenging to learn as it was a big jump in our bootcamp experience, conceptually I now understand how to talk with server using proper code. I also learned how to effectively use insomnia to test endpoints.

When the user does a POST request then the notes will be posted on the db.json file. When the user does a DELETE request with the given id. When the user makes a GET request
they will grab the data in the db.json file. Using insomnia is recommend to test the endpoints located in server.js
